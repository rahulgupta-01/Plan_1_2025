---

## üéØ Objective

**Secure Permanent Residency (PR) in Australia via Bricklaying (ANZSCO 331111)** before my 485 visa expires on **15 February 2028**, and transition back into the IT sector after becoming a PR.

---

- üßë‚Äçüíª Provided hands-on support across Windows, iOS, printers, copiers, and mobile devices

---

## üßæ Visa Background

- **Current Visa**: Subclass 485 ‚Äì Post-Study Work Stream  
- **Granted**: 15 February 2025  
- **Expiry**: 15 February 2027  
- **Extension**: Eligible for a 1-year extension (till 15 February 2028) due to study in a designated regional area (e.g. Gold Coast)  
- **No further 485 or student visas allowed**  
- **No student visa conditions apply**

### üìù Important Clarifications About My 485 Visa
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **I already hold a 485 visa** granted on the basis of my **Bachelor of IT degree** from Griffith University (Gold Coast).  
> 
> ‚úÖ This gives me **2 years initially** (Feb 2025 - Feb 2027) + **1 year regional extension** = **3 years total**  
>
> ‚úÖ **No new student visa (subclass 500) required** - I will complete the Certificate III in Bricklaying while on my existing 485 visa  
>
> ‚úÖ This provides a **substantial time buffer** for completing the Job Ready Program without visa pressure

### üìù Regional 485 Extension Timing Strategy  
> The **1-year regional extension** is granted **from the actual grant date**, **not backdated** to the expiry of your current 485 visa.  
>
> For example, if your visa expires in **February 2027**, and the extension is granted in **July 2027**, it will be valid until **July 2028**.  
>
> ‚úÖ This gives you **extra buffer time** beyond your planned timeline‚Äîhelpful if there are **delays with JRP or PR processing**.  
>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: Perth and Gold Coast have been classified as _regional areas_ since **16 November 2019**, making them eligible for regional migration benefits such as the 485 extension.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Milestone Target

> Lodge your **subclass 190, 491 or 189** visa application **before 15 February 2028**  
> so that you receive a **Bridging Visa A** and can legally remain in Australia while your PR is processed.

## üíº Transition Back to IT (Post-PR)

Once PR is granted, you are **not tied to bricklaying** and can return to the IT field.

### Certifications to Boost IT Profile:
- Microsoft AZ-800 (Windows Server)  
- Microsoft 365 (MS-102)  
- Azure Administrator Associate  
- CCNA (Cisco)  
- RHCSA (Linux)  
- CompTIA Network+ / Security+ (optional)  

### Strategy:
1. Update CV with PR, IT degree, certifications  
2. Apply for roles such as:  
   - IT Support / Helpdesk (L1/L2)  
   - Systems Administrator  
   - Cloud Support (Azure/AWS)  
   - Junior Network Engineer  
3. Use Seek, LinkedIn, GradConnection  
4. Attend WA tech meetups & user groups  

### üìù Note on IT Career Return
> ‚úÖ **The Perth IT job market is robust** with salaries ranging from $65k-$120k+ for various roles  
> 
> ‚úÖ **PR holders have no occupation restrictions** - free to work in any field  
>
> ‚úÖ **Recommended certifications have been validated** by industry experts as sufficient for re-entry

---

## ‚úÖ Final Reminders

- PSA no longer requires WBT (post-July 2023)  
- **Start employment only after completing Cert III**, even if PSA outcome is still pending  
- JRP allows **one-time 90-day backdating**‚Äîmust meet all conditions (see [TRA guidelines](https://www.tradesrecognitionaustralia.gov.au/programs-job-ready-program/guidelines))  
- **Maximum 5 registered employers** during JRP‚Äîregister any change **within 14 days or hours won't count**  
- **Single EVR form** per employer (no separate registration forms since June 2022)  
- WA EOI ranking favours:  
  - WA residents  
  - Construction occupations  
- Lodge PR visa application before 485 expiry to secure Bridging Visa A  

### üéØ Key Strategic Advantages of This Plan:
1. **3-year visa runway** (485 + extension) provides ample time buffer
2. **90-day JRP backdating** allows early work start
3. **Regional extension timing** can add extra months if needed
4. **95 points target** is well above current invitation thresholds
5. **WA construction priority** increases invitation probability
