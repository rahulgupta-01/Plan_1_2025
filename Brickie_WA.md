### (And Transition Back into IT Career)

## 🎯 Objective

**Secure Permanent Residency (PR) in Australia via Bricklaying (ANZSCO 331111)** before my 485 visa expires on **15 February 2028**, and transition back into the IT sector after becoming a PR.

## 🧾 Visa Background

- **Current Visa**: Subclass 485 – Post-Study Work Stream  
- **Granted**: 15 February 2025  
- **Expiry**: 15 February 2027  
- **Extension**: Eligible for a 1-year extension (till 15 February 2028) due to study in a designated regional area (e.g. Gold Coast)  
- **No further 485 or student visas allowed**  
- **No student visa conditions apply**

### 📝 Important Clarification on Regional 485 Extension  
> The **1-year regional extension** is granted **from the actual grant date**, **not backdated** to the expiry of your current 485 visa.  
>
> For example, if your visa expires in **February 2027**, and the extension is granted in **July 2027**, it will be valid until **July 2028**.  
>
> ✅ This gives you **extra buffer time** beyond your planned timeline—helpful if there are **delays with JRP or PR processing**.  
>
> ℹ️ **Note**: Perth and Gold Coast have been classified as _regional areas_ since **16 November 2019**, making them eligible for regional migration benefits such as the 485 extension.

---

## ✅ Key Milestone Target

> Lodge your **subclass 190, 491 or 189** visa application **before 15 February 2028**  
> so that you receive a **Bridging Visa A** and can legally remain in Australia while your PR is processed.

2. Apply for roles such as:  
  - IT Support / Helpdesk (L1/L2)  
  - Systems Administrator  
  - Cloud Support (Azure/AWS)  
  - Junior Network Engineer  
3. Use Seek, LinkedIn, GradConnection  
4. Attend WA tech meetups & user groups  

---

## ✅ Final Reminders

- PSA no longer requires WBT (post-July 2023)  
- **Start employment only after completing Cert III**, even if PSA outcome is still pending  
- JRP allows **one-time 90-day backdating**—must meet all conditions (see [TRA guidelines](https://www.tradesrecognitionaustralia.gov.au/programs-job-ready-program/guidelines))  
- **Maximum 5 registered employers** during JRP—register any change **within 14 days or hours won't count**  
- **Single EVR form** per employer (no separate registration forms since June 2022)  
- WA EOI ranking favours:  
 - WA residents  
 - Construction occupations  
- Lodge PR visa application before 485 expiry to secure Bridging Visa A
