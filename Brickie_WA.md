## üßæ Visa Background

- **Visa:** Subclass **485** ‚Äì Post-Study Work Stream  
- **Granted:** **15 Feb 2025** ‚Üí **Expiry:** **15 Feb 2027**  
- **Regional extension:** **Eligible +1 year** (Gold Coast study) ‚Üí runway to **15 Feb 2028**  
- **Basis:** granted on **Bachelor of IT** (no new student visa desired)  
- **No student visa conditions** apply

### 485 Clarifications
- Can study **GradDip Teaching (Secondary)** on the **485** (no Subclass 500 needed).  
- The **one-year regional 485 extension** is **dated from grant**, not backdated ‚Äî may add extra buffer if granted later.  
- **My timing choice:** I will **apply for the 485 regional extension ~2 weeks before expiry (around 1 Feb 2027)** to **maximise the processing-time buffer** while remaining lawful on a **BVA** if needed.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Milestone

> **Lodge 189/190/491** **before 15 Feb 2028** (or earlier) to obtain a **BVA** while the application processes.

---

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Occupation & Teaching Area

- **ANZSCO 241411 ‚Äî Secondary School Teacher**  
- **Teaching area:** **Digital Technologies / ICT** (aligns cleanly with the B.IT)  
- *Note:* Mathematics typically requires a full university **maths major**; ICT is the cleanest path now. Maths can be added later with further study.

---

## üìã Why This Path Works (Assessment & Registration)

### AITSL (skills assessment for migration)
You must evidence:
- **‚â• 4 years** higher-ed total (e.g., **B.IT** + **1-year ITE GradDip**)  
- **Secondary ITE** with **‚â• 45 days** **supervised professional experience** teaching **Years 7‚Äì12**  
- **English**: either test route (e.g., IELTS) or study route (see AITSL policy)

> **Practicum evidence:** An **official university letter** must state the **number of supervised days** and the **secondary age range** taught. Personal logs help ensure the letter is exact.

### TRBWA (WA teacher registration)
- **Course recognition:** The **SCU GradDip Teaching (Secondary)** is **recognised** by TRBWA.  
- **Apply for Provisional Registration** in your **final term** or at completion (fast-start option for final-year students available).  
- **Professional Standards:**  
  - **Graduate** career stage ‚Üí Provisional Registration  
  - **Proficient** career stage (with recent AU/NZ teaching) ‚Üí Full Registration
- **English for TRBWA (within 2 years of application):**  
  - **IELTS Academic**: **avg 7.5**, **‚â•7.0 each**, **8.0 Listening & 8.0 Speaking**; **or**  
  - Teaching qualification completed **in English** in **AU/NZ/UK/USA/CA/IRL**; **or**  
  - **Exceptional circumstances** (rare, high threshold)

**TRBWA processing goal:** ~**10 weeks**; can be longer if checks/translations/Direct Submission apply.  
**TRBWA fees (AUD):** Provisional **$140** (AUS/NZ grads) / **$473** (overseas-qualified); Full **$178** / **$508**; Annual fee **$95**; Late annual **$59**; Renewal **$56**; Qualification Advice **$330**; Limited Registration (employer-paid) **$235**.

## üèõÔ∏è WA State Nomination (SNMP) ‚Äî Quick Guide

**Streams:** General (**WASMOL Schedules 1 & 2**) and Graduate (GOL).  
**My target:** **General stream ‚Äî WASMOL Schedule 2** for **241411** (eligible for **190** and **491**).

**Ranking (General stream):**
1. **Residing in WA** (top priority)  
2. **Priority sectors** (includes **Education & Training**)  
3. **EOI points**  
4. **Oldest EOI submission date** (tie-breaker)

**Contract rule (190 only):**
- **Full-time (‚â• 35 hrs/wk)** **WA** contract in the **nominated (or closely related) occupation**  
- **‚â• 6 months remaining** at time of **WA nomination** application  
- **Two part-time contracts** can be combined to reach **35 hrs**  
- Include **ANZSCO code**, duties, salary/award, location, and **‚Äúno third-party/outsourcing‚Äù** clause

**491:** **No contract required** (Perth counts as ‚Äúregional‚Äù for 491/191).

**Invitation cadence:** WA runs **monthly rounds**; if an EOI selects both **190** and **491**, expect **491 first** (higher EOI points with +15).

**How to apply ‚Äî condensed steps (WA site):**
1) **EOI in SkillSelect** (choose WA; <45; ‚â•65 points; valid skills assessment; English; occupation available)  
2) **Prepare docs** (identity; WA residency; AITSL outcome; English; contract for 190 if applicable)  
3) **Receive invitation** (ranking rules above)  
4) **Lodge WA nomination** (28 days window)  
5) **Assessment & outcome** (target ~28 working days if decision-ready)  
6) **Nomination in SkillSelect** ‚Üí Home Affairs **ITA**  
7) **Lodge visa** in **IMMI** within **60 days**  
8) **Visa assessment** by Home Affairs  
9) **Register arrival/visa approval** and meet **WA commitments** (live/work in WA per visa conditions)

## ü™ú Step-by-Step (Why each step matters)

1) **Apply SCU (Secondary‚ÄìICT) | Oct 2025 (Perth)**  
   ‚Üí This is the **ITE year** supplying the **‚â•45-day secondary practicum** and TRBWA recognition.

2) **Book points boosters: IELTS/PTE (Superior), NAATI CCL; schedule LANTITE**  
   ‚Üí Locks **~90 points** early and meets course/registration requirements.

3) **Compliance (WWCC, NPC, vax) + ‚ÄúAITSL pack‚Äù setup**  
   ‚Üí Prevents placement/assessment delays; ensures the **SCU practicum letter** captures **days & ages**.

4) **Prac I & II with meticulous logs**  
   ‚Üí Ensures the uni letter is precise ‚Äî crucial for **AITSL**.

5) **Graduate ‚Üí Lodge AITSL (241411) same week results release**  
   ‚Üí The skills assessment unlocks **189/190/491** EOIs.

6) **TRBWA Provisional (final term/at completion)**  
   ‚Üí Legal authority to teach in WA and start working/relief.

7) **EOIs in parallel (on AITSL positive): 189 + 190 + 491**  
   ‚Üí Maximises invitation chances. **190** needs a **WA contract**; **491** doesn‚Äôt.

8) **Accept best invite ‚Üí lodge visa (IMMI)**  
   ‚Üí Locks status. The **485 extension** timing (~2 weeks pre-expiry) preserves maximum buffer to **Feb 2028**.
