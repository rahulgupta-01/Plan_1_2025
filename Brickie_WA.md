# üá¶üá∫ Permanent Residency (PR) Roadmap for Australia via Bricklaying  
### (And Transition Back into IT Career)

---

## üéØ Objective

**Secure Permanent Residency (PR) in Australia via Bricklaying (ANZSCO 331111)** before my 485 visa expires on **15 February 2028**, and transition back into the IT sector after becoming a PR.

---

## üë§ Background

- üéì **Bachelor of Information Technology** (Major: Networks and Security) from **Griffith University, Gold Coast** ‚Äì graduated **Nov 2024**
- üíº Interned as **Infrastructure Delivery Intern** at **Sunshine Coast Council** (Nov 2024 ‚Äì Feb 2025), supporting:
 - Microsoft 365, Active Directory, Azure
 - RemedyForce ITSM, ITIL-based support, server environments
- üë∂ Worked as **OSHC Educator** (Jun 2023 ‚Äì Sep 2024), showing adaptability and leadership
- üçï Worked as **Domino's Shift Runner** (Feb 2022 ‚Äì Aug 2024), managing staff and troubleshooting store IT systems
- üßë‚Äçüíª Provided hands-on support across Windows, iOS, printers, copiers, and mobile devices

---

## üßæ Visa Background

- **Current Visa**: Subclass 485 ‚Äì Post-Study Work Stream  
- **Granted**: 15 February 2025  
- **Expiry**: 15 February 2027  
- **Extension**: Eligible for a 1-year extension (till 15 February 2028) due to study in a designated regional area (e.g. Gold Coast)  
- **No further 485 or student visas allowed**  
- **No student visa conditions apply**

### üìù Important Clarification on Regional 485 Extension  
> The **1-year regional extension** is granted **from the actual grant date**, **not backdated** to the expiry of your current 485 visa.  
>
> For example, if your visa expires in **February 2027**, and the extension is granted in **July 2027**, it will be valid until **July 2028**.  
>
> ‚úÖ This gives you **extra buffer time** beyond your planned timeline‚Äîhelpful if there are **delays with JRP or PR processing**.  
>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: Perth and Gold Coast have been classified as _regional areas_ since **16 November 2019**, making them eligible for regional migration benefits such as the 485 extension.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Milestone Target

> Lodge your **subclass 190, 491 or 189** visa application **before 15 February 2028**  
> so that you receive a **Bridging Visa A** and can legally remain in Australia while your PR is processed.
