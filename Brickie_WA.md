# 🇦🇺 Permanent Residency (PR) Roadmap for Australia via Bricklaying  
### (And Transition Back into IT Career)

---

## 🎯 Objective

**Secure Permanent Residency (PR) in Australia via Bricklaying (ANZSCO 331111)** before my 485 visa expires on **15 February 2028**, and transition back into the IT sector after becoming a PR.

---

## 🧾 Visa Background

- **Current Visa**: Subclass 485 – Post-Study Work Stream  
- **Granted**: 15 February 2025  
- **Expiry**: 15 February 2027  
- **Extension**: Eligible for a 1-year extension (till 15 February 2028) due to study in a designated regional area (e.g. Gold Coast)  
- **No further 485 or student visas allowed**  
- **No student visa conditions apply**

> ### 📝 Important Clarification on Regional 485 Extension  

> The **1-year regional extension** is granted **from the actual grant date**, **not backdated** to the expiry of my current 485 visa.  

> For example, if my visa expires in **February 2027**, and the extension is granted in **July 2027**, it will be valid until **July 2028**.  

> ✅ This gives me **extra buffer time** beyond my planned timeline — which can be very helpful in case of **delays with JRP or PR processing**.  

> ℹ️ **Note**: Perth and Gold Coast have been classified as *regional areas* since **16 November 2019**, making them eligible for regional migration benefits such as the 485 extension.

---

## ✅ Key Milestone Target

> Lodge my **subclass 190, 491 or 189** visa application **before 15 February 2028**  
> So that I receive a **Bridging Visa A** and can legally remain in Australia while my PR is processed.

| Workplace Assessment (JRWA)              | Apr–July 2027         | Mid-JRP assessment                   | July 2027                   |
| Final TRA Skills Assessment (JRFA)       | Oct 2027              | 3–8 weeks                            | Nov 2027                    |

> 🔄 **Note**: While I am aiming to lodge my PR application before the expiry of my current 485 visa in **February 2028**, I will realistically have **additional time** due to the **processing time of my regional 485 extension**.  
> Since the second 485 is granted **from the date of approval**, not backdated, it could give me **extra valid months** (e.g. if granted in July 2027, it expires in July 2028). This acts as a **safety net in case of unexpected delays** in my JRP or nomination process.

## 💼 Transition Back to IT (Post-PR)

Once PR is granted, I am **not tied to bricklaying** and can return to my IT field.

### Certifications to Boost My IT Profile:
- Microsoft AZ-800 (Windows Server)
- Microsoft 365 (MS-102)
- Azure Administrator Associate
- CCNA (Cisco)
- RHCSA (Linux)
- CompTIA Network+ / Security+ (optional)

### Strategy:
1. Update CV with PR, IT degree, certifications
2. Apply for roles like:
   - IT Support / Helpdesk (L1/L2)
   - Systems Admin
   - Cloud Support (Azure/AWS)
   - Junior Network Engineer
3. Use Seek, LinkedIn, GradConnection
4. Attend WA tech meetups & user groups

---

## ✅ Final Reminders

- PSA no longer requires WBT (post-July 2023)
- Bricklayer is exempt from job offer/contract rules in WA
- WA EOI ranking favours:
  - WA residents
  - Construction industry applicants
- Lodge EOI early for best results
- 491 → 191 requires 3 years regional + $53,900 income
- Bridging Visa B needed for travel after 485 expiry
- PR frees me to re-enter IT industry immediately
