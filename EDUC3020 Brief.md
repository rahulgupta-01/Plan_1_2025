Teachers should choose strategies that are research and evidence-based, that are best suited to the outcomes and the students they teach. 

High Impact Teaching Strategies (HITS) are 10 research and evidence based instructional strategies that have a proven effect on students learning. 

### THE TASK –

1.  **Introduction:** curriculum context and scope (subject, course, year, content, skills and knowledge learnt)
2.  **HIT Strategy 1:** quick overview of HIT strategy, what you are teaching (exact outcomes), instructional details (how you are teaching it using the strategy), adjustments for diverse learners, justification of why this strategy best suits the learning for students AND links to research to enhance your justification
3.  **HIT Strategy 2:** quick overview of HIT strategy, what you are teaching (exact outcomes), instructional details (how you are teaching it using the strategy), adjustments for diverse learners, justification of why this strategy best suits the learning for students AND links to research to enhance your justification
