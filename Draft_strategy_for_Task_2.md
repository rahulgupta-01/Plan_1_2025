# **RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Assessment First (Backward Mapping)**

**Why this approach?**
- You already have the summative assessment (focused on 2 outcomes ✓)
- You already have the authentic context (Beachside Café ✓)
- Easier to ensure alignment
- Matches Dom's "look at outcomes first" advice

## **YOUR 7-STEP WORKFLOW**

### **STEP 1: Deconstruct Your Outcomes (30 minutes)**

**Action:**
1. Open your syllabus (pages 11-13 - Unit 2 content)
2. Identify the **2 PRIMARY outcomes** for assessment:
   - **Application Skills** (web authoring - HTML, CSS, multimedia)
   - **Project Management** (client requirements, design process, evaluation)
3. **Highlight the verbs** in each outcome:
   - "Use web authoring applications"
   - "Apply design process"
   - "Ensure digital product meets requirements"
4. Write these on a sticky note - these are your TARGETS

**Output:** Clear understanding of what students must DO by Week 6

---

### **STEP 2: Finalize Your Authentic Context (45 minutes)**

**Action:**
1. Read the Beachside Café client brief I created
2. Customize it if needed (change location, business type, whatever resonates)
3. Write 150 words of "story" to hook students:
   ```
   Example: "You are junior web developers at a Mandurah digital agency. 
   Your first real client is The Beachside Café - a family business 
   struggling to compete with cafés that have professional websites. 
   The owner, Sarah, has a budget of $0 for paid tools but needs a 
   website urgently for the tourist season..."
   ```

**Output:** A compelling scenario that makes the project feel REAL

### **STEP 3: Lock in Your Summative Assessment (1 hour)**

**Action:**
1. Take my summative assessment document (already created)
2. Read through Part 3 completely
3. Customize these sections if needed:
   - Client brief details
   - Technical requirements
   - Due date/submission details
4. **CHECK**: Does this assess ONLY Application Skills + Project Management? ✓
5. **CHECK**: Does the rubric use WA SCSA language? ✓
6. Save this as "Part3_Assessment.docx"

**Output:** Part 3 is 95% complete and saved

---

### **STEP 4: Map the 6-Week Scaffold (2 hours)**

**Action - Use "Shift in Responsibility" framework:**

1. **Open my 24-lesson breakdown** you already have
2. **Color code** or label each week by responsibility level:

   **Weeks 1-2 (Teacher-Led - EXPLICIT TEACHING):**
   - L1-8: Networks basics, HTML/CSS introduction
   - Teacher demonstrates, models, provides worked examples
   - Students follow along, guided practice
   - **CHECK**: Are these lessons mostly "teacher shows → students practice"? ✓

   **Weeks 3-4 (Guided - COLLABORATION):**
   - L9-16: Design principles, legal/ethical, peer work
   - Students work collaboratively with teacher support
   - Formative assessment with feedback
   - **CHECK**: Are students making choices but with scaffolding? ✓

   **Weeks 5-6 (Student-Led - INDEPENDENCE):**
   - L17-24: Project work, independent creation, evaluation
   - Teacher becomes facilitator/consultant
   - Students manage their own process
   - **CHECK**: Are students working independently? ✓

3. **Adjust any lessons** that don't fit this progression
4. Make notes on the breakdown document

**Output:** 24-lesson plan verified with clear responsibility shift

---

### **STEP 5: Draft the Unit Plan Table (3-4 hours)**

**Action:**

1. **Create new Word document** called "Task2_Draft.docx"
2. **Start with landscape page** for the lesson table
3. **Create the 5-column table** structure
4. **Transfer content** from my 24-lesson breakdown:
   - Copy Week 1 lessons first (4 lessons)
   - Paste into table, format cells
   - Continue week by week
5. **As you paste, ask yourself** (Dom's refinement process):
   - "Does this activity build toward the café website project?"
   - "Will students have the skills for the assessment?"
   - "Is the shift in responsibility clear?"
6. **Adjust/refine** as needed while pasting

**Output:** Part 1 main lesson table complete in Word

---

### **STEP 6: "Dance with AI" for Your Resource (2-3 hours)**

**Action:**

1. **Identify the gap**: Where in Weeks 3-5 do students need support?
   - Recommended: **Project Task Planner/Checklist** for Weeks 5-6
2. **Open ChatGPT/Claude** and start the "dance":

   **Prompt 1:** 
   ```
   "I need a website project task planner for Year 11 students creating 
   a business website. It should have: milestones (Planning, Development, 
   Testing), checkboxes, self-assessment column. The project is for a 
   café client. Create a table structure."
   ```
   
   **Save this prompt immediately!**

3. **Review output** → What's good? What's missing?

4. **Prompt 2 (iteration):**
   ```
   "Good start. Now add: specific HTML/CSS tasks under Development, 
   WCAG accessibility checkpoints, and teacher checkpoint dates in 
   Weeks 5-6."
   ```
   
   **Save this prompt!**

5. **Prompt 3 (refinement):**
   ```
   "Add a column for NCCD adjustments showing how Student A (vision 
   impairment) and Student B (ASD) can use this differently."
   ```

6. **Take the AI output** and add YOUR expertise:
   - Align tasks with WA syllabus wording
   - Add Beachside Café context
   - Insert specific lesson numbers
   - Create teacher notes section

7. **Track the split**: 
   - AI generated: ~40% (structure, initial content)
   - You created: ~60% (customization, alignment, context)

**Output:** GenAI resource complete + full documentation of prompts

---

### **STEP 7: Write the Context Sections & Assemble (2 hours)**

**Action:**

1. **Add portrait pages BEFORE the lesson table** in your Word doc
2. **Write these sections** using my outline as a guide:
   - 1.1 Course Information (copy from outline)
   - 1.2 Unit Context (100-150 words - where it fits in year)
   - 1.3 Unit Overview (200-250 words - use my template)
   - 1.4 Course Aims (5 aims with explanations)
   - 1.5 Adjustments table (Students A, B, C)
3. **After the lesson table, add:**
   - 1.6 Assessment Schedule
   - 1.7 Unit Evaluation

4. **Insert page break** after Part 1

5. **Add Part 2** (GenAI Resource):
   - 2.1 Title and Purpose
   - 2.2 The Resource itself
   - 2.3 GenAI Documentation (prompts, split, iteration)
   - 2.4 Teacher Notes
   - 2.5 Student Instructions

6. **Insert page break** after Part 2

7. **Add Part 3** (copy from your saved assessment document)

8. **Final checks:**
   - Page breaks correct?
   - Landscape/portrait orientations right?
   - All hyperlinks work?
   - Headers consistent?

**Output:** Complete Task 2 draft ready for polishing!
