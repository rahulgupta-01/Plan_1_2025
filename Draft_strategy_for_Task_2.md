# 2. RUBRIC FORENSIC BREAKDOWN - WHAT GETS HD+

## **Criterion 1: Design of Learning Experiences (20%) - 25-30 marks**

### **What HD+ Requires:**

| HD+ Descriptor | Specific Evidence Required | How to Demonstrate |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| "Unit sequence exceptionally coherent" | Clear weekly progression; each week builds logically | Show Week 1 (foundation) → Week 2-3 (development) → Week 4-5 (application) → Week 6 (synthesis) |
| "Innovative design beyond standard expectations" | NOT generic "group work" - name specific protocols | Label strategies: "Jigsaw cooperative learning," "Design Thinking Double Diamond," "Gallery Walk protocol" |
| "At least 4 varied, high-impact strategies per week" | Must COUNT and explicitly state | "Week 1 employs 5 active strategies: (1) Think-Pair-Share, (2) Jigsaw groups, (3) Worked examples, (4) Hands-on practice, (5) Exit tickets" |
| "Creativity/innovation deeply embedded with measurable success criteria" | SC must be SPECIFIC and MEASURABLE | ❌ "Understand networks"<br>✅ "Explain 3 advantages and 2 disadvantages of business networks with examples" |
| "Literacy and numeracy integration sophisticated and discipline-specific, EXPLICITLY STATED in learning intentions and activities" | Must label literacy/numeracy in BOTH LI and activities | **LI:** "Develop technical literacy by reading client briefs"<br>**Activity:** "Literacy: Students read and annotate technical documentation; Numeracy: Calculate file compression ratios" |
| "Student independence strongly promoted through structured choice, reflection, and self-assessment tools" | Must show independence scaffolds | Include: choice boards, self-assessment rubrics, reflection protocols, task planners with self-monitoring |

**Critical Actions:**
1. **Count your strategies** - In Unit Overview, state total: "This unit employs 18 distinct active learning strategies across 24 lessons"
2. **Make literacy/numeracy EXPLICIT** - Add a row or notation in EVERY lesson
3. **Label innovation** - Don't say "students work together," say "students collaborate using Jigsaw protocol with assigned expert roles"

---

## **Criterion 2: Curriculum Alignment (15%) - 13-15 marks**

### **What HD+ Requires:**

| HD+ Descriptor | Specific Evidence Required | How to Demonstrate |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| "All selected course outcomes (≥3) precisely cited (codes and wording)" | WA uses AIMS - must cite ≥3 AIMS exactly as worded on p.6 | Copy exact wording: "Aim 1: Apply a structured design process to create or modify digital solutions in response to a client brief..." |
| "Explicitly mapped to lessons and assessments" | Every lesson shows which aim(s) addressed | Add "Aims" column to table OR note in Unit Content: "Aims 1, 3, 5" |
| "Content scope and cognitive demand exceed minimum Year 11 standards" | Must go beyond basic syllabus requirements | Show extension: advanced CSS (flexbox/grid), JavaScript basics, portfolio development |
| "Sequencing exemplary - demonstrates deep understanding of curriculum intent" | Clear progression: foundational → complex | Week 1-2: Explicit teaching (networks, HTML basics)<br>Week 3-4: Guided practice (CSS, design)<br>Week 5-6: Independent application (project work) |
| "Terminology and assessment policy applied with complete accuracy and sophistication" | Use ONLY WA SCSA language from syllabus | Use exact syllabus content wording from pp.11-17; use SCSA grade descriptors (p.20-21) |

**Critical Actions:**
1. **Use "Aims" not "Outcomes"** - Emma's feedback: WA Technologies uses AIMS
2. **Map aims to lessons** - Add notation showing which aims each lesson addresses
3. **Copy syllabus content EXACTLY** - Don't paraphrase; use exact wording from Unit 2 content pages

---

## **Criterion 3: Learner Diversity & Inclusion (5%) - 5 marks**

### **What HD+ Requires:**

| HD+ Descriptor | Specific Evidence Required | How to Demonstrate |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|

| "Specific, well-justified adjustments documented for ALL identified groups" | Must cover all 4 groups | 1. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students<br>2. EAL/D students<br>3. Students with disability<br>4. Extension/gifted students |
| "UDL principles deeply embedded (multiple means of engagement, representation, expression)" | Must LABEL UDL principles in adjustments | Add UDL labels: "[UDL: Multiple means of Representation] Video with captions + transcript" |
| "Adjustments highly tailored and demonstrably eliminate barriers, ensuring equity beyond compliance" | Specific to individual lessons, not generic | ❌ "Extra time provided"<br>✅ "Student A: +25% time (68min instead of 55min), high-contrast materials (min 16pt font), screen reader compatible files" |

**Example Adjustment Structure (use or adapt):**

| Student | Need | Embedded Adjustments |
|---------|------|---------------------|
| **Student A** (example name - rename as needed) | Physical disability - Vision impairment | **[UDL: Multiple means of Representation]** High contrast materials (min 16pt font), screen reader compatible, audio alternatives<br>**[UDL: Multiple means of Expression]** Digital submission only, no handwriting required |
| **Student B** (example name) | Autism Spectrum Disorder | **[UDL: Multiple means of Engagement]** Task checklists, visual timers, structured templates, predictable routines, defined roles in group work |
| **Student C** (example name) | EAL/D - Developing stage | **[UDL: Multiple means of Representation]** Bilingual glossaries, visual supports, sentence starters<br>**[UDL: Multiple means of Expression]** Additional processing time (+10%) |
| **All students** | Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives | Cultural connections: digital divide in remote communities, Aboriginal business examples, respectful protocols for imagery |
| **Extension students** | High achievers needing challenge | Advanced techniques (CSS Grid, JavaScript), additional page types, leadership/mentoring roles, portfolio development |

**Critical Actions:**
1. **Label UDL principles** - Add "[UDL: ...]" tags to adjustments
2. **Cover all 4 groups** - Check you have Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander, EAL/D, disability, extension
3. **Specific to lessons** - Each lesson's adjustments must relate to THAT lesson's activities

---

## **Criterion 4: Lesson Sequencing & Pedagogy (10%) - 9-10 marks**

### **What HD+ Requires:**

| HD+ Descriptor | Specific Evidence Required | How to Demonstrate |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| "Lessons show exceptional sequencing across ALL 6 weeks" | No gaps or jumps; clear building of skills | Show how L2 builds on L1, L12 requires skills from L1-11, etc. |
| "Active strategies in ≥90% of lessons" | 22 out of 24 lessons must have active strategies | Only 2 lessons can be primarily teacher-led (e.g., final assessment submission) |
| "Formative assessment systematically embedded (checks for understanding, exit tickets, drafts with feedback loops)" | Majority of lessons have formative checks | Include exit tickets, quick checks, peer review, draft submissions |
| "**Includes a comprehensive feedback plan that is timely, actionable, and differentiated for learner needs**" | **EXPLICIT feedback plan required - this is a separate component** | **Create feedback plan table/section showing WHEN, WHAT TYPE, HOW USED, DIFFERENTIATION** |

**CRITICAL: Feedback Plan Requirement**

The rubric specifically states "includes a comprehensive feedback plan" - this is NOT optional.

**Create a Feedback Plan Section (example structure):**

| Lesson | Feedback Type | Timing | Purpose | Differentiation |
|--------|--------------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| L1 | Written feedback on exit tickets | Start of L2 (next lesson) | Address misconceptions about networks | Student C receives simplified language feedback |
| L4 | Verbal feedback during circulation | During L4 project planning activity | Guide improvements to action plans | Student B receives structured checklist format |
| L12 | Written feedback on formative task | Returned within 1 week | Identify knowledge gaps before summative | All students: 2 stars (strengths) + 1 wish (improvement) |
| L20, L22 | Teacher checkpoint conferences (5min each) | During project work lessons | Monitor progress, provide specific next steps | Student A: verbal + written summary; Student B: scheduled predictable time |
| L24 | Summative feedback with rubric | Returned within 2 weeks of submission | Final assessment, feed-forward for Year 12 | Differentiated by criterion performance |

**Critical Actions:**
1. **Create explicit feedback plan** - Add as Section 1.6 or embedded in lesson table
2. **Show variety** - Include verbal, written, peer, self-assessment feedback
3. **Show timing** - Specify when feedback is given (immediate, next lesson, within 1 week)
4. **Show differentiation** - How feedback is adapted for diverse learners

## **Criterion 5: Teaching Resource Quality (15%) - 13-15 marks**

### **What HD+ Requires:**

| HD+ Descriptor | Specific Evidence Required | How to Demonstrate |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| "Resource is original, highly informed, and exemplary in quality, fully fit-for-purpose" | NOT generic - tailored to THIS specific unit | Resource must reference specific lesson numbers, unit content, authentic context (e.g., "Beachside Café project") |
| "Design exceptionally clear, concise, accessible (alt text, captions, layout optimized)" | Accessibility features embedded | Include alt text for images, high contrast, readable fonts, structured headings |
| "Includes comprehensive teacher notes AND student instructions" | Both must be present and detailed | Teacher notes: when to use, how to model, differentiation<br>Student instructions: what it is, when to use, how to use, where to submit |
| "Demonstrates ethical and ADVANCED use of GenAI with full prompt/process transparency and originality beyond compliance" | Must show sophisticated iteration process | **Minimum 3 prompt iterations documented**<br>Show refinement process<br>State AI% vs Original% |

**GenAI Documentation Requirements (CRITICAL for HD+):**

**❌ NOT HD+ (basic compliance):**
```
I used ChatGPT to create a task planner.

## **Criterion 6: Summative Assessment Alignment (20%) - 17-20 marks**

### **What HD+ Requires:**

| HD+ Descriptor | Specific Evidence Required | How to Demonstrate |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| "Summative task directly assesses multiple outcomes (≥3) with explicit mapping to programmed content" | Must assess ≥2-3 AIMS (not all 5) | **CRITICAL: Emma's feedback - "limit outcomes... couple maximum"**<br>Focus on 2 primary aims, note others assessed formatively |
| "Highly authentic to the discipline" | Must mirror real professional practice | Client-driven project, business context, industry standards |
| "Instructions, conditions, due date, weighting, submission requirements exceptionally clear and comprehensive, fully aligned with course policy" | Every detail included, no ambiguity | Must include: task description, technical requirements, word counts, file formats, submission method, due date/time, weighting %, aims assessed, marking criteria |
| "Demonstrates strong validity, high reliability, feasibility" | Rubric criteria measurable; task doable | Rubric uses observable verbs; task completable in 6 weeks with available resources |
| "Includes advanced academic integrity measures (unique prompts, staged submissions, process checks)" | Must show integrity safeguards | Staged submissions (drafts, checkpoints), process documentation required, unique authentic context |

**CRITICAL: Focus Assessment on 2-3 Aims (Emma's Workshop Feedback)**

**What the Credit example did (NOT best practice):**
- Assessed 5 outcomes simultaneously
- This violates workshop guidance

**What you MUST do for HD+:**
- Focus on **2 primary aims** (e.g., Application Skills 65% + Project Management 35%)
- Explicitly state: "Following EDUC3020 workshop guidance to focus assessment for validity and reliability, this task assesses TWO primary aims rather than all five course aims"
- Note how other aims assessed: "Aims related to Networks and Managing Data assessed through Week 3 formative task and ongoing formative assessment"

**Example Assessment Focus Statement:**

```
AIMS ASSESSED IN THIS TASK

PRIMARY FOCUS (Direct Assessment):

Aim 3: Application of industry standards, management techniques and 
technical skills to produce high-quality digital outcomes (65% of marks)
└─ Assessed through: Web development technical skills (HTML/CSS), 
   responsive design, accessibility implementation, file optimization

Aim 1: Apply a structured design process to create digital solutions 
in response to client brief (35% of marks)
└─ Assessed through: Client requirements analysis, project planning, 
   design documentation, evaluation against requirements

ASSESSED THROUGH OTHER MEANS:
├─ Aim 2 (Hardware/software understanding): Week 1-3 network design 
│  lessons and Week 3 formative task
├─ Aim 4 (Legal/ethical awareness): Week 4 lessons on Privacy Act, 
│  copyright compliance required in project
└─ Aim 5 (Data security): Week 6 system maintenance lesson, secure 
   file practices throughout project

RATIONALE:
This focused approach ensures the assessment has strong validity 
(assesses what it intends to assess), reliability (consistent marking 
across students), and manageability (students can demonstrate mastery 
within time/resource constraints).
```

**Critical Actions:**
1. **Focus on 2 primary aims** - Don't try to assess everything in one task
2. **Map to taught content ONLY** - Only assess what was actually taught in lessons
3. **Include staged submissions** - Show process checks (L20 checkpoint, L22 checkpoint, L24 final)
4. **State explicit focus rationale** - Reference workshop feedback

---

## **Criterion 7: Rubric Quality (10%) - 9-10 marks**

### **What HD+ Requires:**

| HD+ Descriptor | Specific Evidence Required | How to Demonstrate |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| "Rubric criteria precisely derived from mapped outcomes and fully measurable/observable (no vague terms)" | Criteria link to aims; use action verbs | Each criterion states which aim it assesses; uses verbs like "applies," "creates," "evaluates" (not "understands") |
| "Performance levels exceptionally well differentiated with specific evidence descriptors" | Must include frequency, accuracy, sophistication | A grade: "4+ accessibility features," "flawless HTML validation," "sophisticated CSS techniques"<br>C grade: "3 accessibility features," "mostly valid HTML," "adequate CSS" |
| "Designed as exemplary student-facing document, structured according to standards-referenced levels" | Students can self-assess; uses A-E grades | Clear language students understand; matches WA SCSA grade system |
| "Demonstrates advanced clarity for moderation (comprehensive, consistent, easy for multiple markers)" | Any teacher could apply rubric consistently | Specific, observable descriptors eliminate marker interpretation |

**CRITICAL: WA SCSA Language Requirements**

You MUST use the exact language from WA SCSA Grade Descriptors (syllabus Appendix 1, pp.20-21):

| Grade | Required Language Pattern (from syllabus) |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| **A** | "**Applies and justifies**...", "**Independently selects and uses**...", "**consistently creating sophisticated and original**..." |
| **B** | "**Applies and explains**...", "**Selects and uses**...", "**consistently creating original**..." |
| **C** | "**Applies and describes**...", "**Uses applications**...", "creating digital products" |
| **D** | "**Attempts to apply**...", "**inconsistently**...", "**incomplete digital products**..." |
| **E** | "Does not meet the requirements of a D grade" |

**Example Criterion Using SCSA Language:**

```
CRITERION: Web Development - Application Skills (30 marks)
[Assesses Aim 3: Application of industry standards and technical skills]

Grade A (25-30 marks):
Independently selects and uses web authoring applications using a range 
of relevant and complex features, consistently creating sophisticated and 
original digital products. HTML structure is semantically correct with 
advanced elements (nav, section, article tags). CSS demonstrates complex 
techniques (flexbox, grid, custom properties) with consistent, professional 
styling. All navigation and multimedia integration work flawlessly with 
optimized performance.

Grade B (20-24 marks):
Selects and uses web authoring applications using a range of appropriate 
features, consistently creating original digital products. HTML structure 
is valid with appropriate semantic elements. CSS shows effective styling 
with mostly consistent application. Navigation works on all pages. 
Multimedia elements well-integrated and optimized.

Grade C (15-19 marks):
Uses applications to create digital products using a range of application 
features. HTML structure is mostly valid with some semantic elements. CSS 
provides adequate styling with some inconsistencies. Navigation generally 
works with minor issues. Multimedia elements present and adequately optimized.

Grade D (9-14 marks):
Attempts to use applications to create incomplete digital products, using 
a limited range of application features. HTML structure has validation 
errors but pages display. CSS is basic with significant inconsistencies. 
Navigation has several broken links. Multimedia optimization inconsistent.

Grade E (0-8 marks):
Does not meet the requirements of a D grade and/or has completed 
insufficient work.
```

**Critical Actions:**
1. **Copy SCSA language exactly** - Use "applies and justifies" (A), "applies and explains" (B), "applies and describes" (C)
2. **Make descriptors specific** - Include numbers (4+ features, 3 features, 1-2 features)
3. **Use observable evidence** - Things markers can SEE, not infer ("HTML validates with 0 errors" not "shows good understanding")
4. **Check every descriptor** - Search your rubric for vague words: "good," "understanding," "demonstrates" - replace with SCSA language

# 4. WORKED EXAMPLE ANALYSIS - WHY IT'S ONLY CREDIT

## **Understanding the Example Level**

**Heads up:** The provided worked example is labeled **"Mid-range Credit level"**

This means it demonstrates **C grade work** (satisfactory achievement), NOT HD+ work.

### **What the Food Technology Example Does Well (Credit = C):**

| Aspect | What It Has |
|--------|-------------|
| Structure | ✓ Has clear sections and organization |
| Outcomes | ✓ Lists outcomes (P2.2, P3.2, P4.1, P4.4, P5.1) |
| Activities | ✓ Describes teaching and learning activities |
| Adjustments | ✓ Includes adjustments for 2 students |
| Assessment | ✓ Has assessment task with rubric |
| Resources | ✓ Lists resources needed |

### **What Makes It Only CREDIT Level (NOT HD+):**

| Aspect | Credit Example Approach | What HD+ Requires |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Learning Activities Format** | Brief bullets:<br>• Students complete pre-test<br>• Complete experiment<br>• Develop brochure | ✓ This concise format is actually CORRECT<br>BUT must add: explicit strategy naming, literacy/numeracy labels |
| **Success Criteria** | Sometimes vague:<br>"Students will be able to identify characteristics" | Must be MEASURABLE:<br>"Students will identify 4 sensory characteristics (appearance, odor, taste, texture) and explain how each affects food quality perception" |

**CRITICAL CORRECTION:**

| ❌ WRONG (NSW/other states) | ✅ CORRECT (WA) |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| "Outcomes Addressed" | "Course Aims Addressed" |
| "This lesson addresses Outcome 3.2" | "This lesson addresses Aim 3" |
| "The assessment assesses Outcomes P4.1, P4.2" | "The assessment assesses Aims 1 and 3" |

**Where are the AIMS?**
- Syllabus page 6: "Aims" section
- 5 aims total for the AIT ATAR course

### **4. HITS Documentation**

**Emma's Feedback:**
> "Use the HITS documentation provided"
> "Cite the provided HITS resources where relevant"
> "Use them to support your pedagogical decisions, not just describing the strategy"

**What HITS Means:**
- High Impact Teaching Strategies (Victorian Department of Education framework)

**What You Must Do:**
1. **Don't just name strategies** - cite HITS research
2. **Don't use generic terms** - specify which HITS strategy

**Example:**

❌ WRONG:
"Students work in groups to research network topologies"

✅ CORRECT:
"Students engage in Collaborative Learning (HITS Strategy 7) using Jigsaw protocol where expert groups research different network topologies (wired star, wireless, peer-to-peer) then regroup to teach peers, promoting peer-to-peer dialogue and knowledge construction (Department of Education & Training, 2017)."

**Required Reference:**
Department of Education and Training (2017). *High Impact Teaching Strategies: Excellence in teaching and learning*. State of Victoria. https://www.education.vic.gov.au/hits

### **5. Learner Needs Specificity**

> "Explain how adjustments are embedded within teaching and learning activities"
> "Avoid listing categories without explaining how they influence your planning"

**What You Must Do:**

❌ NOT ENOUGH:
"Adjustments for students with disability"

✅ REQUIRED:
"Student A - Mia - Physical disability: Vision impairment (cortical visual impairment) characterized by difficulty distinguishing low-contrast text, eye strain from small fonts, and visual processing challenges with rapid screen transitions."

**Include for Each Student:**
1. **Name** (can be pseudonym)
2. **NCCD Category**: Physical, Cognitive, Sensory, Social-Emotional
3. **Specific Condition**: ASD, dyslexia, vision impairment, EAL/D stage, etc.
4. **How it Affects Learning**: What challenges they face in YOUR lessons
5. **Embedded Adjustments**: SPECIFIC actions in SPECIFIC lessons

### **6. Activity-Aim Alignment**

**Emma's Feedback:**
> "Clear alignment between learning activities and curriculum outcomes"
> "Activities are explicitly linked to curriculum outcomes"
> "It is clear what students are learning and why that learning is included"

**What You Must Do:**

❌ VAGUE:
"Students learn about networks"

✅ EXPLICIT:
"**Aim 2 Addressed:** Students design LAN topology for small business scenario, demonstrating understanding of hardware components (servers, routers, switches) and their functions. This addresses Aim 2 (understanding computer hardware/software to select appropriate digital tools) by requiring students to make informed infrastructure decisions based on business connectivity requirements."

**Add to Each Lesson:**
- Which aim(s) this lesson addresses
- WHY this content/activity is essential for meeting that aim

### **7. Pathway Specification**

**Emma's Feedback:**
> "For Task 2, everyone should be working with a Year 11 Technologies syllabus"
> "You must clearly specify: The course title, Whether the course is ATAR or General"

**What You Must Do:**
State in Section 1.1 table:

| Course Title | Applied Information Technology ATAR |
| Pathway | ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) |

<a name="word-count-strategy"></a>
# 6. WORD COUNT STRATEGY

## **Understanding "~2000 Words"**

**From Task Brief:**
> "Word limit: 2000"
> "Approximately 2000 words (tables/lists don't count)"

**From Rubric Criterion 8 HD+:**
> "Writing is **concise**, highly professional, and polished"

### **What This Means:**

1. **Tables/lists format doesn't count** toward 2000-word limit
2. **BUT** you still must be concise (HD+ requirement)
3. **Narrative sections** (paragraphs) count toward 2000

### **Word Allocation Across Parts:**

| Section | Format Type | Approx Words | Counts Toward 2000? |
|---------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **1.1** Course Information | Table | N/A | No (it's a table) |
| **1.2** Unit Context | Paragraph | 150 | Yes |
| **1.3** Unit Overview | Paragraph | 250 | Yes |
| **1.4** Course Aims (5 aims × 100 words each) | Paragraphs | 500 | Yes |
| **1.5** Adjustments Table | Table with some prose | 50 | Partially (prose parts) |
| **Lesson Table** | Table (bullets in cells) | See below | No (table format) BUT be concise |
| **1.6** Assessment Schedule | Table + intro paragraph | 100 | Yes (paragraph part) |
| **1.7** Unit Evaluation | Paragraph | 200 | Yes |
| **Part 2** - GenAI Documentation | Paragraphs | 400 | Yes |
| **Part 2** - Teacher/Student Notes | Paragraphs | 150 | Yes |
| **Part 3** - Assessment Overview | Paragraph | 300 | Yes |
| **Part 3** - Rubric | Table | N/A | No (it's a table) |
| **TOTAL COUNTED** | | **~2100** | **Slightly over but acceptable** |

### **Lesson Table Word Count Strategy:**

**The Activities Column:**

Even though it's in table format (doesn't count), you should still be CONCISE for HD+ ("concise, professional writing").

**Format:** Structured bullets, NOT paragraphs

**Example of CORRECT concise format:**

```
Week 1, Lesson 1

Unit Content: Networks - concept, purpose, advantages/disadvantages

Activities:
• LI: Understand why businesses use networks
• SC: Explain 3 advantages, 2 disadvantages with examples

Teaching Activities:
• Hook: Video "How Networks Work" (3min) - note-taking
• Explicit teaching: Business examples (café, school), define LAN/WAN/network
• Think-Pair-Share: Why would 5-employee business need network?
• Guided practice: Venn diagram - standalone vs networked computers
• Exit ticket (Google Form): List advantages/disadvantages

Literacy: Reading technical definitions, vocabulary acquisition (LAN/WAN)
Numeracy: N/A this lesson

Adjustments:
• Student A: [UDL: Representation] Video captions, Venn diagram A3/digital
• Student B: [UDL: Engagement] Note template, visual timer, assigned partner
• Student C: [UDL: Representation] Glossary, paired support

Assessment: Formative - Exit ticket, observation

Resources: 
• Video: Computer Networks https://...
• Venn diagram template (Google Classroom)
• Exit ticket form
```

**Word count per lesson:** ~120-150 words in Activities column

**Total for 24 lessons:** ~3000-3600 words in Activities column

**BUT** this is table format, so doesn't count toward 2000-word limit.

**STILL:** Be concise. Don't write paragraphs. Use bullets.

# 8. COMPLETE TASK STRUCTURE WITH EXAMPLES

## **PART 1: UNIT OF WORK**

### **Example: Section 1.4 - Course Aims Addressed**

**(Use this structure, adapt content to your unit)**

```
SECTION 1.4: COURSE AIMS ADDRESSED

This unit addresses all five aims from the Applied Information Technology 
ATAR course (SCSA, 2023, p. 6):

AIM 1: Apply a structured design process to create or modify digital 
solutions in response to a client brief, exploring multiple ideas, 
evaluating alternatives, and effectively communicating and refining 
their proposals

[Your explanation: 2-3 sentences about HOW your unit addresses this aim]

Example:
Students apply a comprehensive design process throughout the 6-week unit, 
beginning with client requirements analysis for [your authentic context - 
e.g., "The Beachside Café"] in Week 1, where they investigate business 
needs and define project scope. During Weeks 2-4, students explore multiple 
design approaches through wireframing and prototyping, evaluating 
alternatives for navigation structures and content organization. In Weeks 
5-6, students refine their proposals based on formative feedback and 
systematically evaluate their final digital solution against client criteria.

[Continue for Aims 2-5...]
```

## **PART 2: GENAI RESOURCE**

### **Example: GenAI Documentation Section**

**(Follow this structure exactly)**

```
SECTION 2.3: GENERATIVE AI USE STATEMENT

AI Tool Used: ChatGPT 4 (OpenAI)
Date of Use: [Your date]

PROMPTS USED:

PROMPT 1 (Initial Request):
"[Your exact first prompt - copy-paste from ChatGPT]"

AI Output 1: 
[Brief description of what AI generated - 2-3 sentences]

Issues Identified:
[What was wrong or missing - 2-3 bullet points]

PROMPT 2 (Refinement):
"[Your exact second prompt - copy-paste]"

AI Output 2:
[What improved - 2-3 sentences]

Remaining Issues:
[What still needed work - 2-3 bullet points]

PROMPT 3 (Further Iteration):
"[Your exact third prompt - copy-paste]"

AI Output 3:
[Final output description - 2-3 sentences]

[Continue if you have more iterations...]

AI-GENERATED CONTENT (approximately X% of resource):
The following elements were generated by AI:
• [Specific element 1 - e.g., "Initial table structure with 6-week framework"]
• [Specific element 2 - e.g., "Basic task category headings"]
• [Specific element 3 - e.g., "Generic milestone descriptions"]

MY ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTION (approximately X% of resource):
I made the following original contributions:
• [Your contribution 1 - e.g., "Modified all content to align with WA SCSA 
  Unit 2 specific content areas (networks, managing data, application 
  skills, project management)"]
• [Your contribution 2 - e.g., "Integrated [your authentic context] 
  throughout all tasks and examples"]
• [Your contribution 3 - e.g., "Created NCCD adjustments column with 
  specific strategies for Students A, B, and C"]
• [Your contribution 4 - e.g., "Added hyperlinks to specific lesson 
  resources and assessment rubric criteria"]
• [Your contribution 5 - e.g., "Redesigned layout for accessibility 
  (high contrast, clear headings, structured format)"]

ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
[100-150 words explaining your refinement journey]

Example:
I began by requesting a basic website project task planner structure. The 
initial AI output provided a generic 6-week framework but lacked specificity 
for the Applied Information Technology context and didn't address diverse 
learner needs. Through iterative prompting, I refined the resource by 
requesting specific HTML/CSS task breakdowns, WCAG accessibility checkpoints, 
and differentiation strategies. My second iteration focused on integrating 
the authentic [your context] scenario and aligning tasks with WA SCSA 
syllabus content. The final iteration added self-assessment reflection 
prompts and teacher checkpoint scheduling. Throughout this process, I 
critically evaluated each AI output against Unit 2 syllabus requirements 
and student learning needs, ultimately creating a resource where 65% 
reflects my original pedagogical expertise and 35% represents AI-generated 
structural scaffolding.

HIGHLIGHTED AI CONTENT:
In the actual resource document, AI-generated content is highlighted in 
YELLOW for transparency.

Example:
AIM 1: Apply a structured design process to create or modify digital 
solutions in response to a client brief

Assessment Focus: Client requirements analysis, project planning and 
documentation, design justifications, systematic evaluation against 
client criteria
Weighting: 35% of total marks (Rubric Criteria 3, 4, 5: 50 marks)

---

ASSESSED THROUGH OTHER MEANS:

• Aim 2 (Hardware/software understanding): Week 1-3 network design lessons 
  and Week 3 formative assessment task on LAN topology design

• Aim 4 (Legal/ethical awareness): Week 4 lessons on Privacy Act 1988, 
  digital divide, e-commerce ethics; copyright compliance required in 
  website project

• Aim 5 (Data security): Week 6 system maintenance lesson, secure file 
  practices demonstrated throughout project development

RATIONALE FOR FOCUSED ASSESSMENT:

Following EDUC3020 workshop guidance (Emma Lord, February 2026) to "limit 
the amount of outcomes... a couple maximum" for validity and reliability, 
this summative task focuses on TWO primary aims rather than attempting to 
assess all five course aims simultaneously. This focused approach ensures:

• Strong validity: Task assesses what it intends to assess without 
  construct-irrelevant variance
• High reliability: Clear, specific criteria enable consistent marking
• Manageability: Students can demonstrate mastery within time and resource 
  constraints
• Authenticity: Task mirrors real professional web development practice 
  requiring both technical skills (Aim 3) and project management (Aim 1)

Other course aims are assessed through formative tasks, ongoing observation, 
and embedded learning activities throughout the unit, ensuring comprehensive 
coverage of all course aims across multiple assessment opportunities.
```

# 9. DRAFT STRATEGY - STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW

## **RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW (Assessment-First Approach)**

### **PHASE 1: PLANNING & SETUP (2-3 hours)**

**Step 1: Choose Your Authentic Context (30 min)**

Create a realistic client scenario relevant to students and Unit 2 content.

**Examples:**
- **Option A:** Small business website (café, bakery, bookshop, gym)
- **Option B:** Community organization website (sports club, charity, youth group)
- **Option C:** School-related website (subject department, student club, school event)

**Your context should:**
- Be realistic and relatable to students
- Require web development (HTML/CSS)
- Allow for network design component
- Enable discussion of legal/ethical issues (Privacy Act, accessibility)

**Example (feel free to use or adapt):**
"The Beachside Café - a family-owned café in Mandurah struggling to compete with businesses that have professional websites. Owner needs a site for the tourist season with menu, location, contact info, and mobile-friendly design."

**Step 2: Identify Your Diverse Learners (30 min)**

Create 3 specific student profiles + 1 group:

**Student A:** Disability (choose NCCD category)

   - Visual organizers

---

### **PHASE 2: DRAFT PART 3 FIRST (4-5 hours)**

**Why start with Part 3?**
- Ensures your lessons build toward assessment
- Clarifies exactly what to teach
- Prevents scope creep

**Step 6: Write Assessment Task Description (1 hour)**

Create:
- Authentic context (client brief)
- Technical requirements (HTML/CSS specifications)
- Submission requirements (parts, word counts, file formats)
- Instructions (how to submit, when, where)

**Step 7: Create Rubric Using SCSA Language (2-3 hours)**

Design 5 criteria:
- 2 criteria for Aim 3 (technical skills)
- 3 criteria for Aim 1 (project management)

**For each criterion:**
- A descriptor: "Independently selects and uses... applies and justifies..."
