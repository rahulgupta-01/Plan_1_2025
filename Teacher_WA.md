# 🇦🇺 Permanent Residency (PR) Roadmap — **Secondary School Teacher (ICT)**

**ANZSCO:** **241411 — Secondary School Teacher**  
**Teaching area:** **Digital Technologies / ICT**  
**Location** **Perth, Western Australia**  
**Last reviewed:** Sep 2025

---

## 🎯 Objective

Secure Australian PR via **Secondary School Teacher (241411)** using the strongest option available (**189 / 190 / 491**), with **ICT/Digital Technologies** as my teaching area.  
**Target:** lodge PR (or 491) **before 15 Feb 2028** and step into a stable WA teaching role.

---

## 👤 Background

- **B.Information Technology (Networks & Security)** — Griffith University, Gold Coast — **Nov 2024**
- **Infrastructure Delivery Intern** — Sunshine Coast Council (Nov 2024 – Feb 2025): M365, AD, Azure, RemedyForce, ITIL, servers
- **OSHC Educator** (Jun 2023 – Sep 2024) — leadership & duty-of-care
- **Domino’s Shift Runner** (Feb 2022 – Aug 2024) — team lead + store IT troubleshooting
- Hands-on support across Windows, iOS, printers, copiers, mobiles
- **Resident in Perth (WA)**

---

## 🧾 Visa Background

- **Visa:** Subclass **485** – Post-Study Work Stream  
- **Granted:** **15 Feb 2025** → **Expiry:** **15 Feb 2027**  
- **Regional extension:** **Eligible +1 year** (Gold Coast study) → runway to **15 Feb 2028**  
- **Basis:** granted on **Bachelor of IT** (no new student visa desired)  
- **No student visa conditions** apply

### 485 Clarifications
- Can study **GradDip Teaching (Secondary)** on the **485** (no Subclass 500 needed).  
- The **one-year regional 485 extension** is **dated from grant**, not backdated — may add extra buffer if granted later.  
- **Timing choice:** I will **apply for the 485 regional extension shortly before expiry (~1–2 weeks prior)** to **maximise bridging visa buffer** while remaining lawful on a **BVA** if needed.

---

## ✅ Key Milestone

> **Lodge 189/190/491** **before 15 Feb 2028** (or earlier) to obtain a **BVA** while the application processes.

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Occupation & Teaching Area

- **ANZSCO 241411 — Secondary School Teacher**  
- **Teaching area:** **Digital Technologies / ICT** (aligns cleanly with the B.IT)  
- *Note:* Mathematics typically requires a full university **maths major**; ICT is the cleanest path now. Maths can be added later with further study.

---

## 📋 Why This Path Works (Assessment & Registration)

### AITSL (skills assessment for migration)
You must evidence:
- **≥ 4 years** higher-ed total (e.g., **B.IT** + **1-year ITE GradDip**)  
- **Secondary ITE** with **≥ 45 days** **supervised professional experience** teaching **Years 7–12**  
- **English**: either test route (e.g., IELTS) or study route (see AITSL policy)

> **Practicum evidence:** An **official university letter** must state the **number of supervised days** and the **secondary age range** taught. Personal logs help ensure the letter is exact.

### TRBWA (WA teacher registration)
- **Course recognition:** The **SCU GradDip Teaching (Secondary)** is **recognised** by TRBWA.  
- **Apply for Provisional Registration** in the **final term** or at completion (fast-start option available).  
- **Professional Standards:**  
  - **Graduate** career stage → Provisional Registration  
  - **Proficient** career stage (with recent AU/NZ teaching) → Full Registration
- **English for TRBWA (within 2 years of application):**  
  - **IELTS Academic**: **avg 7.5**, **≥7.0 each**, **8.0 Listening & 8.0 Speaking**; **or**  
  - Teaching qualification completed **in English in Australia/NZ/UK/USA/CA/IRL** (exempt pathway); **or**  
  - **Exceptional circumstances** (rare, high threshold)

**TRBWA processing goal:** ~**10 weeks**; longer if checks/translations/Direct Submission apply.  
**TRBWA fees (AUD):** Provisional **$140** (AUS/NZ grads) / **$473** (overseas-qualified); Full **$178** / **$508**; Annual fee **$95**; Late annual **$59**; Renewal **$56**; Qualification Advice **$330**; Limited Registration (employer-paid) **$235**.

## 🏛️ WA State Nomination (SNMP) — Quick Guide

**Chosen stream:** **General — WASMOL Schedule 2 only** (no Schedule 1 or Graduate stream).

**Ranking (General stream):**
1. **Applicants residing in WA** are prioritised over interstate or offshore  
2. **Priority sectors** (includes **Education & Training**)  
3. **EOI points**  
4. **Oldest EOI submission date** (tie-breaker)

**Contract rule (190 only):**
- **Full-time (≥ 35 hrs/wk)** **WA** contract in the **nominated (or closely related) occupation**  
- **≥ 6 months remaining** at time of **WA nomination** application  
- **Two part-time contracts** can be combined to reach **35 hrs**  
- Contract must include **ANZSCO code**, duties, salary/award, location, **“no third-party/outsourcing”** clause, and **dated signatures** from both parties  

**491:** **No contract required** (Perth counts as “regional” for 491/191).

**Invitation cadence:** WA runs **monthly rounds**; if an EOI selects both **190** and **491**, expect **491 first** (higher EOI points with +15).

---

## 🪜 Step-by-Step (Why each step matters)

1) **Apply SCU (Secondary–ICT) | Oct 2025 (Perth)**  
   → This is the **ITE year** supplying the **≥45-day secondary practicum** and TRBWA recognition.

2) **Book points boosters: IELTS/PTE (Superior), NAATI CCL; schedule LANTITE**  
   → Locks **~90 points** early and meets course/registration requirements.

3) **Compliance (WWCC, NPC, vax) + “AITSL pack” setup**  
   → Prevents placement/assessment delays; ensures the **SCU practicum letter** captures **days & ages**.

4) **Prac I & II with meticulous logs**  
   → Ensures the uni letter is precise — crucial for **AITSL**.

5) **Graduate → Lodge AITSL (241411) immediately**  
   → The skills assessment unlocks **189/190/491** EOIs.

6) **TRBWA Provisional (final term/at completion)**  
   → Legal authority to teach in WA and start working/relief.

7) **EOIs in parallel (on AITSL positive): 189 + 190 + 491**  
   → Maximises invitation chances. **190** needs a **WA contract**; **491** doesn’t.

8) **Accept best invite → lodge visa (IMMI)**  
   → Locks status. The **485 extension** timing (~1–2 weeks pre-expiry) preserves maximum buffer to **Feb 2028**.

## 🧾 WA State Nomination — What I’ll Enter & Upload

### Step 1: EOI (SkillSelect)
- **State:** WA (or “any state/territory” if broad)  
- **Age:** <45  
- **Points:** ≥65 (target ~90)  
- **Skills assessment:** **AITSL positive** — 241411  
- **Occupation:** on **WASMOL Schedule 2** (General stream)  
- **English:** at least **Competent** (claim **Superior** for points)

### Step 2: Documents (before invitation)
- Identity + **WA residency** (lease/bank/insurance/driver’s licence renewal)  
- **AITSL** outcome (241411)  
- **English** (IELTS/PTE or exempt via AU qualification)  
- **190 only:** WA **full-time contract (≥ 35 hrs)** in nominated/closely related occupation, **≥ 6 months remaining**; can combine **two contracts**; include ANZSCO, duties, salary/award, location, **no third-party clause**, **dated signatures**

### Steps 3–6: Invitation → WA app → Nomination → ITA
- WA invites **monthly** (491 usually first if both ticked)  
- **28 days** to submit WA application; processing target ~**28 working days** if **decision-ready**  
- On approval, WA nominates in SkillSelect → **Home Affairs ITA** (60 days to lodge visa)

### Steps 7–9: Visa → Outcome → WA commitments
- Meet federal criteria; after grant:  
  - If interstate/offshore: move to WA within **3 months**, register arrival, live/work in WA **2 years**, complete surveys  
  - If already in WA: register grant date; live/work in WA **2 years**, complete surveys  
  - **491 → 191**: after 3 years in regional WA with taxable income ≥53,900/year (current threshold, subject to change)

## 🧠 Pro Tips & Risk Controls

- **Do tests early** (IELTS/PTE & NAATI) → bank points and avoid clashes with prac.  
- **Keep prac evidence tight** → SCU **official practicum letter** must show **days** and **secondary ages (Years 7–12)**.  
- **Parallel EOIs** once AITSL is positive (189 + 190 + 491).  
- **Contract wording matters (190)** → use template to avoid WA queries.  
- **TRBWA timing** → expect ~**10 weeks**; delays if ACIC/AIS checks pending or Direct Submission used.  
- **Annual TRBWA fee ($95)** due by **31 March**; late fee **$59** in April; after April → cancellation steps.  
- **OSHC** must be maintained until PR/citizenship pathway is secure if any interim student visa is ever needed.

---

## 🧭 After Grant / Alternate Paths

- **If 189/190 PR:** continue in ICT teaching; explore EdTech/CS leadership.  
- **If 491:** live/work in **regional WA** (Perth counts) → meet income/time → **191 PR**.  
- Add **Mathematics** as a second teaching area later by completing sufficient uni-level maths.
