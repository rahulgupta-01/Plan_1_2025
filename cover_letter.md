Recruitment Team  
Catholic Education Northern Territory  
Darwin, NT 0828

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the ICT Coordinator position at Aboriginal Catholic Community Schools (ACCS) under Catholic Education Northern Territory (CENT). With a Bachelor of Information Technology (Networks and Security) from Griffith University and hands-on experience in ICT infrastructure management, I am well-positioned to support CENT's mission of providing efficient, functional IT systems across your school network.

My professional experience directly aligns with the key responsibilities outlined in your position description:

* **ICT Infrastructure & Client Device Management:** At Sunshine Coast Council, I managed and maintained Standard Operating Environments (SOE) for desktops and servers while supporting infrastructure and network operations in a large organization. I also handled routine maintenance of wireless and LAN networks, ensuring optimal connectivity across facilities.

* **Technical Support & System Administration:** I have demonstrated experience administering Microsoft 365, Active Directory, and Group Policy to enforce robust access controls. My experience with RemedyForce ITSM for incident management and asset tracking transfers well to CENT's Enterprise Service Management platform needs.

* **Technology Training & Capacity Building:** I developed and delivered training sessions on integrated ICT systems at Sunshine Coast Council, building staff capacity to use technology efficiently. Additionally, as a Shift Runner at Domino's Pizza, I trained new employees on store technologies and troubleshooting protocols.

* **Remote Work & Cultural Sensitivity:** I understand the unique challenges of providing IT support in remote locations and am fully prepared to work in remote Aboriginal communities (1 week remote, 1 week in Berrimah office). I respect Aboriginal culture and am committed to upholding the Catholic Ethos in all aspects of my work.

* **End-User Support:** My experience troubleshooting Windows 10/11 environments, desktops, laptops, iOS devices, printers, and Chromebooks has equipped me with the technical skills to provide effective Level 2 help desk support and liaise with external service providers when necessary.

Beyond technical qualifications, my experience as an OSHC Educator has developed my communication skills and ability to build relationships with diverse communities. I am fluent in English, Hindi, Urdu, and Punjabi, which enhances my ability to work effectively in multicultural environments.

I am particularly drawn to CENT's commitment to providing culturally relevant education for Aboriginal students while upholding values of Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Compassion, and Love. These values align with my own commitment to using technology to create inclusive, supportive learning environments.

I currently hold a Queensland Driver License and Working with Children Check (Blue Card) and am prepared to obtain NT equivalents. I am also pursuing further professional development through ITIL, CCNA, and Microsoft Azure certifications.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to CENT's mission of educational excellence. Please feel free to contact me at 0466 564 251 or rahulguptamps@gmail.com.

Sincerely,

Rahul Gupta
