Hiring Manager  
Daydream Island Resort & Living Reef  
Whitsundays QLD 4741    

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the IT Support Technician position at Daydream Island Resort & Living Reef, as advertised on 05 March 2025. I hold a Bachelor of Information Technology with a major in Networks and Security from Griffith University, and my practical experience in IT support and system administration gives me confidence in my ability to contribute effectively to your organization within its unique tropical setting.

My professional qualifications and experiences are closely aligned with the requirements of this position:

- **Hardware and Software Installation:** During my tenure at Sunshine Coast Council, I installed and configured hardware and software systems, ensuring uninterrupted functionality across various departments. For example, I assisted in setting up new work phones and devices at a council site as part of the service desk team, which streamlined the onboarding process and minimized technical issues.

- **Troubleshooting:** I have extensive experience in diagnosing and resolving technical difficulties promptly, including systems similar to those utilized in hotel entertainment operations. For example, I assisted in diagnosing a faulty router at a council site and performed a router replacement at another council site, which enhanced overall network reliability.

- **System Maintenance:** I performed regular backups and system updates diligently, safeguarding data integrity and optimizing performance. For example, I decommissioned outdated PRTG monitoring setups for legacy systems and reorganized PRTG objects to align with VMware groupings, resulting in improved system monitoring efficiency.

- **Teamwork:** During my internship at Sunshine Coast Council, I collaborated with both the service desk and infrastructure teams to resolve technical issues effectively. For example, when covering additional responsibilities, I coordinated with colleagues to address connectivity challenges and streamline system monitoring processes, thereby ensuring uninterrupted IT support across departments.

I am inspired by the commitment of Daydream Island Resort & Living Reef to sustainability and eco-tourism, principles that resonate strongly with my personal dedication to environmental responsibility. The prospect of contributing to an organization that combines luxury with ecological stewardship excites me, and I am eager to apply my skills in support of a team devoted to these commendable values. My enthusiasm stems not only from the professional opportunities presented but also from the alignment of my ideals with the resort's mission to preserve its natural surroundings.

I am fully prepared to relocate to Airlie Beach and undertake the daily ferry commute to Daydream Island. I hold a valid Queensland Driver License and am adaptable to the logistical demands of island-based employment.

I express my gratitude for your consideration of this application. I would be honored to discuss how my qualifications and expertise may serve your distinguished team. Please do not hesitate to contact me at 0466 564 251 or via email at rahulguptamps@gmail.com.

Sincerely,

Rahul Gupta
