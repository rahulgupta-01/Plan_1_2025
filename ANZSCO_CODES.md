# ANZSCO Code Mapping for Job Descriptions 🔍💼

This text contains the select list of selected ANZSCO codes relevant to me and their employment duties as assessed by ACS in Australia. **Read each duty carefully.**

The purpose of this exercise is to perform a line-by-line duty mapping between the ANZSCO codes and a new job/role description. For each duty:
- **Compare the ANZSCO duty with the corresponding duty from the new job description.**
- **Assign a match score out of 100 for each duty.**

> **After comparing each duty and assigning them scores, provide an overall match score (out of 100) for the ANZSCO code.**

> **The goal is to find the closest ANZSCO code associated with that job description.**

## 📋 Detailed instructions for Mapping

1. **Review the Complete Duties:**  
   Read each and every duty under every ANZSCO code below.

2. **Line-by-Line Comparison:**  
   For each duty:
   - List the **ANZSCO duty** (exactly as provided)  
   - List the **corresponding duty** from the new job/role description  
   - Provide a **match score** out of 100 for how closely they align.

   **Example:**  
   - **ANZSCO Duty:**  
     > "working with users to formulate and document business requirements"  
   - **Job Description Duty:**  
     > "Collaborate with clients to gather and document business requirements for software solutions"
