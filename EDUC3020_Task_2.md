## THE TASK - What do I need to do?

Create a unit of work, assessment task and lesson for a Year 11 course. The syllabus/curriculum should be from the State in which you intend to teach in. The unit plan should meet assessment requirements of the course and include details of formal assessment task/s (weightings and outcomes) that address the diverse needs of a few students in a Year 11 class.

By creating a unit of work you are practising formulating sequences of strategies and learning activities that are aligned to curriculum and assessment policy. This will also provide you with a unit of work you can use when you start teaching.

Units in senior school don’t always coincide with the school term. The unit program you design should run for 6 weeks and include an associated summative assessment task. The learning in the unit should culminate in a task submitted at the conclusion of the unit.

Before you start, let your Lecturer know which state and which subject you will be writing for.

## PART 1 - Unit of work:
- 6 weeks of 55 minute lessons, 4 per week, and appropriate for all students  
- Use the template options provided  
- Content taught should be assessed (using a range of strategies)  
- Assessment details included (weighting and outcomes)  

---

## PART 2 – One resource:
- Use Gen AI to create one teaching and learning resource appropriate for all students that you would use in the unit. The role of Generative AI is to iteratively develop the resource and should not be another person’s work.  
- The one resource could be a digital quiz, a task planner/checklist, time management tool, annotated sample, or a resource to teach content from such as a PPT or Word Document.  

---

## PART 3 - Assessment Task:
- Create one summative assessment task appropriate for all students that should correspond to the unit plan content  
- Include and assess learning and content from the unit plan  
- Have a marking criteria/rubric  
- Use the template option provided  

---

## Considerations:
- Choose a unit/task that demonstrates your understanding of curriculum and syllabus documents through the careful selection of appropriate outcomes from your chosen subject  
- Use strategies in the program that include and showcase active, inclusive teaching and are suitable for senior students  
- Include quality teaching strategies that suit a broad range of abilities and needs  
- You are making a resource that you can use in your teaching, therefore, all weblinks, YouTube links and other sources should be hyperlinked

## What knowledge and skills do I need to demonstrate in this task?

### Learning outcomes assessed:
1. Develop innovative teaching programs and units of work with innovative pedagogical approaches for sequential learning in Technologies subjects, including differentiation to meet the diverse needs and interests of students  
2. Critically analyse the principles and practices of keeping accurate and reliable records and writing reports for students, parents and care givers  
3. Demonstrate extensive knowledge of assessment practices including rubrics, marking guidelines, marking criteria and the use of performance band descriptors for Technologies courses, and for the evaluation of teaching to inform future planning and practice  
4. Critically analyse suitable management practices including: budgeting and selecting, storing, maintaining and replacing materials and equipment within a Technologies department

## SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS – How do I submit this task?

Use PAGE BREAKS in Word to have both portrait and landscape page orientation.

Submission of ONE document (Word not PDF) is to be done via TURNITIN. The submission link can be found in the Assessment Tasks and Submission Tab on BlackBoard.

It is YOUR responsibility to ensure that you have submitted the correct file and the FINAL version of your assessment for marking BEFORE the due date/time.

After you have followed the TurnItIn submission process you will receive an email. CHECK YOUR STUDENT EMAIL AND KEEP A COPY OF THIS. If you do not receive this email, this means that your assessment has not been properly submitted.

If you have any difficulty submitting your assignment, please contact Technology Services and make sure that you log a job with them so you have evidence of your attempted submission. To avoid any last-minute problems, make sure you submit well before 11.59pm.

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY – How do I ensure my work has academic integrity?

GenAI may be used for this assessment.

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, are encouraged for parts of this Assessment Task. If you use GenAI tools, you must use these ethically and acknowledge their use. To find out how to reference GenAI in your work consult the referencing style for your unit via Learning Zone. If you are not sure how to, or how much you can use GenAI tools in your studies, contact me as your Unit Assessor. If you use GenAI tools without acknowledgment it may result in an academic integrity breach against you as described in the Student Academic and Non-Academic Misconduct Rules, Section 3.

### Acceptable limits:
Based on the Academic Quality, Standards and Integrity Policy, Principle 7 (clause 44c), the acceptable limit for the use of GenAI for this assessment task is defined as:
- The use of ANY tools that fall into the following categories: text content creation, language translation, image content creation  
- NO tools from the following categories: sound content creation, coding creation, video creation  

ALL GenAI generated content in this assessment must be acknowledged using the relevant referencing style for your unit – see the Learning Zone.

The proportion of GenAI content should not exceed 30% – all AI generated content should be visible, highlighted and clearly identified through referencing.

For any written work where you use or refer to a source of information or image that is not your own, APA 7th referencing protocols must be used. Refer to the following source if you are unsure as to what is required:  
<https://libguides.scu.edu.au/apa/about-apa>

Your written document should be checked through TURNITIN before submission to check for Academic Integrity. The link for Turnitin can be found in the Assessment Tasks and Submission area on BlackBoard. You will receive a similarity report which checks that you have referenced your work correctly. You are expected to copy and paste outcomes and content from your state’s syllabus/curriculum documents. Similarity checker should demonstrate the areas of copying and pasting from the syllabus/curriculum documents. The similarity could be anywhere from 15%–20%.

   - QLD unit plan template  
   - NSW programming template guide  
   - Vic Planning resources  
   - OR the supplied template  

2. Links, resources and references are to be hyperlinked and embedded in the unit plan  

3. APA referencing to be used ONLY when and if required (e.g. for a textbook), and to be placed at the end of the document.
