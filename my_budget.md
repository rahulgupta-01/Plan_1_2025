## **Personal Savings Strategy** 💡

To build consistent savings, I transfer **$20 every day** (totalling **$140/week**) to my **nab account**.  
This helps me stay disciplined and grow my savings steadily throughout the year.  
**Staying consistent with this small daily habit builds a powerful financial cushion over time.**

- **$20/day = $140/week**  
- **$140/week ≈ $607/month** (based on 4.33 weeks/month on average)  
- **$140/week × 52 weeks = $7,280/year**

## **Quarterly & Annual Tax Safety Plan** 🧾✅

To avoid surprises during quarterly BAS or at tax time, I follow this strategy:

- I use my **ubank account** as a dedicated buffer account for **GST and income tax**.
- **Each week**, I transfer:
  - **$150 to cover GST**
  - **$150 to cover income tax**
- I aim to **never touch this money** except for official ATO payments.
- This way, I’ll always have **enough saved up** to meet my GST and tax obligations when they're due.
- I also try to use my **ubank debit card** for any **business-related expenses**, so they are easy to track and claim.

## **Additional Financial Notes** 📌

- I have to pay **income tax annually**, based on my taxable income after business deductions.
- As a rideshare driver:
  - I **charge 10% GST** on each fare.
  - I **submit a BAS every quarter**, paying collected GST and claiming credits on eligible expenses.
- Since I use my **own car 100% for work**, I claim:
  - **Fuel, depreciation, loan interest, insurance, maintenance, registration**, etc.
  - I follow the **logbook method** to maximize deductions.
- I’m also working to **reduce my weekly expenses**, so I can **save more than $140/week** consistently.
