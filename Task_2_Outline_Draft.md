```
This unit addresses the following aims from the Applied Information Technology ATAR course (SCSA, 2026):

**Aim 1: Apply a structured design process to create or modify digital solutions in response to a client brief**

[Write 2-3 sentences: e.g., "Students apply the design process throughout the 6-week unit, beginning with client requirements analysis in Week 1, developing prototypes in Weeks 2-4, and evaluating their final website against client criteria in Week 6. The café website project requires students to investigate client needs, explore multiple design approaches, and refine their solution based on feedback."]

**Aim 2: Understand computer hardware and software to select and use appropriate digital tools for client-driven solutions**

[Write 2-3 sentences about Weeks 1-3 networks content: "Students develop understanding of network hardware components (routers, servers, switches) and design appropriate network topologies for small business contexts. This technical knowledge enables them to make informed decisions about digital infrastructure when creating web-based solutions."]

**Aim 3: Apply industry standards, management techniques and technical skills to produce high-quality digital outcomes**

[Write 2-3 sentences about HTML/CSS standards, accessibility, optimization: "Students learn and apply web development standards including HTML5 semantic structure, CSS styling conventions, WCAG accessibility guidelines, and file optimization techniques. Project management skills are developed through the use of version control, time management strategies, and systematic testing procedures."]

**Aim 4: Develop awareness of legal, ethical and social considerations in digital solution development**

[Write 2-3 sentences about Privacy Act, copyright, digital divide: "Lessons 13-16 explicitly address legal frameworks (Privacy Act 1988, Copyright Act 1968) and ethical considerations (digital divide, accessibility) relevant to web development. Students must demonstrate copyright compliance in their projects and implement accessibility features to ensure equitable access."]

**Aim 5: Critically examine issues related to data security, distribution and responsible digital practices**

[Write 2-3 sentences about cloud security, data protection, anti-malware: "Students explore data security through lessons on cloud storage practices, system maintenance tools, and privacy protection. The website project requires students to implement secure data handling practices and consider the implications of collecting user information through contact forms."]

## **Section 3.8: Marking Criteria (THE RUBRIC)**

**Heading**: Marking Criteria

**Paragraph before rubric** (50-100 words):
"This assessment uses standards-referenced marking criteria aligned with the WA SCSA Applied Information Technology ATAR Year 11 syllabus. Your work will be assessed against five criteria using grade descriptors (A-E) based on the syllabus Appendix 1 (pages 20-21). Each criterion uses WA SCSA language: 'applies and justifies' (A), 'applies and explains' (B), 'applies and describes' (C), 'attempts to apply' (D)."
